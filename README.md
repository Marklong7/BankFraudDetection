## The Dataset:
The **Bank Account Fraud (BAF) dataset**, released by Jesus et al. [1] at **NeurIPS 2022**, is a large-scale, privacy-preserving suite of realistic tabular datasets. Feature Selection, Differential Privacy, and necessary Categorization are applied to ensure the dataset is both privacy-protected and realistic. Based on the noised dataset, the authors then use the CTGAN model to generate 2.5M instances and sample 1M of them to reduce the data size. There are 30 features in the dataset, including sensitive features such as age and income.

Derived from a major consumer bank, the BAF dataset was used to detect fraudulent online bank account applications. In this scenario, fraudsters attempt to access banking services with fake information, then quickly max out credit lines or use the accounts to receive illicit payments.

### Performance Metric:
We select the threshold in order to obtain 5% false positive rate (FPR), and measure the true positive rate (TPR) at that point.
### Fairness Metric:
We measure the ratio between FPRs, i.e., predictive equality [2]. The ratio is calculated by dividing the FPR of the group with lowest observed FPR with the FPR of the group with the highest FPR.
